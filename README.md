# kitdm-pycli
This Python project contains a collection of command line clients for different KIT Data Manager services. The clients
are supposed to be used to ease local administration, for testing, and automated operations.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* [Optional] base-repo installation
* [Optional] MetaStore installation
* [Optional] Typed PID Maker installation
* [Optional] Keycloak installation

## Installation and setup

After cloning the repository, start with installing the dependencies by calling

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

Optionally, especially when you are modifying code, you may call available tests via:

```bash
poetry poe test
```

Afterwards, the configuration file `properties.example.json` must be modified to fit your local setup and moved to
`properties.json` in the current folder. The configuration options in the file are grouped by service and should be
self-explaining. If you are unsure, contact your local infrastructure administrator to obtain missing information.

If you want to use multiple properties files for different setups, you may point to the appropriate file via its
absolute path set as the environment variable `PYCLI_PROPERTIES`. If not set, `properties.json` is expected to be
located in the current folder.

If all properties are correctly set, one of the available clients can be used. For details, please refer to the
following chapters.

## base-repo-client

*base-repo-client.py* allows to perform many operations on a configured base-repo instance to create, read, update,
and delete resources and their file contents. Basic usage information is printed below, but can also be obtained via

```commandline
poetry run base-repo-client --help
```

For details about a particular operation, e.g., createResource, help can be obtained via

```commandline
poetry run base-repo-client createResource --help
```

### Main Usage Information - base-repo

```commandline
usage: base-repo-client.py [-h] [-a | --auth | --no-auth] [-r {TABLE,LIST,RAW}] [-o OUTPUT] [-d | --debug | --no-debug]
                           {createResource,createContent,getResource,getResources,getContent,downloadContent,updateResource,patchResource,patchContent,deleteResource,deleteContent} ...

Command line client interface for the base-repo service.

positional arguments:
  {createResource,createContent,getResource,getResources,getContent,downloadContent,updateResource,patchResource,patchContent,deleteResource,deleteContent}
                        Operation selection
    createResource      Create a new data resource.
    createContent       Create a new content element.
    getResource         List metadata for one or more single resources.
    getResources        List metadata for all resources,optionally filtered by creation time.
    getContent          List metadata for one or more resource's content elements.
    downloadContent     Download content from a resource.
    updateResource      Update a resource's metadata providing a complete resource metadata document that will replace the existing version.
    patchResource       Patch a resource's metadata. In comparison the the update, the patch operation accepts an RFC 6902 JSON Patch document instead of all resource metadata.
    patchContent        Patch content metadata.
    deleteResource      Delete one or more single resource(s) and all its contents.
    deleteContent       Delete content.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --auth, --no-auth
                        Switch for enabling/disabling authentication before the actual service request. If enabled, the KeyCloak instance configured in properties.json is used. By default, the user is asked for username and
                        password. However, both can also be configured in properties.json such that only missing information is requested, e.g., if the password is not stored in properties.json, which is anyway only recommended
                        in a protected environment.
  -r {TABLE,LIST,RAW}, --render_as {TABLE,LIST,RAW}
                        This parameter allows to configure the way results are rendered. By default, a user-friendly representation as table is printed where results are returned. The visible columns of the table can be
                        configured in properties.json.Alternatively, only the resource ids can be printed for further processing or the raw result can be returned.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The absolute or relative path of an output file used to store the output of the performed operation, e.g., a file download or the rendered result. If used in combination with --render_as TABLE or LIST
                        outputs that can rendered as such are re-formatted depending on the output file extension. Supported extensions are .csv (comma separated), .json (structured table), and .html (web table). If not
                        provided, all outputs are printed to stdout.
  -d, --debug, --no-debug
                        Enable verbose output for debugging. Disabled by default. (default: False)
```
